    Block all negative energy out your life. Surround yourself with positivity
    and good vibes. Become and peace with your emotional state. You need to
    realize that <em>NO ONE</em> is never always happy. Nor are they each and
    every day optimistic or the better versions of themselves. Holding yourself
    to fair expectations is an essential aspect of self-love. You need to accept
    that some days are going to be better than others, and that having an off
    day, or week, or depression time is totally okay. Checking in with your
    emotional situation often is crucial so that you can understand your moods
    and learn to embrace them.
