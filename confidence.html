        Build up your confidence and self esteem
      </h1>
      An essential part to being able to self love and care is being able to
      realize that you can't describe beauty. Beauty is what
      <strong>you</strong> see it as. Self-esteem can play a major role in your
      motivation and success all your life. Low self-esteem may hold you back
      from being successful at school or at work,because you don't believe that
      you are capable of success.
      <h2>
        What is self esteem?
      </h2>
      <span id="what-is"
        >Self-esteem is an individual's subjective evaluation of their own
        worth. There are two types of self esteem. There's High and Low. High
        self-esteem means that you believe in yourself and know that you are a
        wonderful addition to this universe. You see, you may have a few
        weaknesses, but you also have a lot of strengths that really shape who
        you are.Then there's low self esteem, low self-esteem means you
        don't really believe in yourself. You frequently compare yourself to
        other people, and feel that you don't match up, which is discouraging.
        You prefer to concentrate on your weaknesses, rather than focus on your
        strengths.</span
