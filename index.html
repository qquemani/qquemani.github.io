    </h2>
    <p font-size:18px;>
      There's no such thing as perfect. My purpose of this website is to make
      girls feel beautiful, safe, and to help them to become connected and
      comfortable with their naturality. No matter the race, size, or looks.
      This website helps to dig deeper into your inner you, your inner beauty,
      and more. You are beautiful. Here, all things are accepted. Nobody's
      perfect but this is an imperfect safe space for all females.

              Self-love is not self centered, you could never genuinely love

      What is self love?
    </h1>
    <p id="opening-question">
      The definition of self love is different for each person. Self-love is
      important for living well. This affects who you choose for a friend, the
      picture you portray, and how you deal with the issues in your
      life. Self-love is not simply a state in which one feels good, it is a
      state of self-esteem that develops overtime. Self-love is complex, it
      evolves through habits that mature us. When we behave in ways that expand
      self-love in us, we tend to embrace our limitations and strengths much
      more and we start to have less need to justify our failures. To describe
      self-care, it's essentially the act of physically and mentally taking care
      of yourself. Self-love means unapologetically enjoying yourself, while
      self-care is about taking the time to feel good on your skin. Although
      these two are distinct, both are necessity for a safe, fulfilled
      lifestyle.
