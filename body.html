      Mindsets affect your life expectancy. We often try to fulfill everyone's
      needs around us, but forget about ours. Yet being mindful of our own
      needs, both physical and emotional, is what self-care requires. Connect
      with your inner self. A lack of connection to your inner self will make
      you function as if you're pretending.  To protect yourself from the truth
      of the outside world, you will feel like you need to create a mask
      and/or a shield. Experts say that it can help you avoid doing this by
      communicating with your inner self. It's never too late to try to do this.
