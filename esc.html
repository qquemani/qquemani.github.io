      Escaping all negativity
    </h1>
    <span id="donkey"
      >Block all negative energy out your life. Surround yourself with
      positivity and good vibes. Become and peace with your emotional state. You
      need to realize that <strong>NO ONE</strong> is never always happy. Nor
      are they each and every day optimistic or the better versions of
      themselves. Holding yourself to fair expectations is an essential aspect
      of self-love. You need to accept that some days are going to be better
      than others, and that having an off day, or week, or depression time is
      totally okay. Checking in with your emotional situation often is crucial
      so that you can understand your moods and learn to embrace them.</span
