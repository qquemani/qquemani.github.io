      Forgivness and Moving On
    </h2>
    <p class="intro-sentence">
      To be able to truly love yourself, you have to be able to move on and let
      bygones be bygones. You can't always live in the past. Mistakes are bound
      to happen. You don't always have to be strong and take everything in, but
      one thing you can do is be brave.
